These are some hacky scripts to work on the ESP32 based Toniebox.

**Everything here is dangerous, unusable and very much work-in-progress.**

Basically a collection of notes and tools to aid in reverse engineering.
None of this is meant for end-users (at this time).

For stable results keep an eye on TeddyCloud instead: https://github.com/toniebox-reverse-engineering/teddycloud
